### Mr. Jones

Mr. Jones is old. Real old. Old enough to remember when politicians were scared of him, not the other way around. Mr. Jones misses those days. Since retirement, his life has gotten easier in some ways but more obnoxious in others. His knees don't work quite like they used to so he depends on his Jazzy to get him around. But traversing the sidewalks between his home and the green-grocer's is a life-threatening event. His grandkids set him up with one of those wireless touchscreen thingies so he's connected to the interwebs and he'd like to use the iThingie to contact his local representatives to get them to fix the sidewalks already.
