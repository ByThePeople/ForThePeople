# User Scenarios

### Jessica

Jessica is a 30-something, single mother suburbanite whose parents are facing serious medical problems. She needs time off work to arrange care for both of them, and she worries that her employer will deny her leave because her company is too small to fall under FMLA. She worries about how she would provide for her children without a job to return to after her parents' affairs have been arranged. She thinks there should be a law protecting people like herself from losing their jobs while on leave. An election is on the horizon, representatives are listening to constituents, and she wants to contact her representatives to tell them to strengthen FMLA protections.


### Mr. Jones

Mr. Jones is old. Real old. Old enough to remember when politicians were scared of him, not the other way around. Mr. Jones misses those days. Since retirement, his life has gotten easier in some ways but more obnoxious in others. His knees don't work quite like they used to so he depends on his Jazzy to get him around. But traversing the sidewalks between his home and the green-grocer's is a life-threatening event. His grandkids set him up with one of those wireless touchscreen thingies so he's connected to the interwebs and he'd like to use the iThingie to contact his local representatives to get them to fix the sidewalks already.
