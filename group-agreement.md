# Group Agreement

### Communication Plan
-	Introduced some personal info already so we know each other
-	Make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
-	Don’t attack people.
-	Try not to cut off people.
-	Make sure loud and soft voices heard should be easy because none of us is an extrovert.
-	If we have an idea we don’t want to forget, write it down and bring it up when someone else is not talking.
- Use small room in the AM & Grace Hopper in the PM so we can hear each other.

### Conflict Plan
-	Bring up issues in group first if possible
-	If issue unresolved, bring in TA or Stephanie
- If we can't bring up an issue right away, we introverts might put something in the middle of the table per [Stephanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanielingwood/).
- Slack is also an option.
- This is a non-partisan political site. Let's use purple, not red or blue.

### Workflow/Git
-	Don’t merge own PR.
-	Mostly use a development branch, only merge to master when features work.
-	Write lots of issues and assign so we can all get commits
-	We’ll make sure that we all contribute to JavaScript, CSS, meaty problems, etc, by taking a paired programming approach as much as possible.
-	Also use mob programming!
-	For CSS: Use a style guide? Make it only good enough to present.
-	Have everyone view a PR before merging.
- Every morning, group pull from development
