### Civic Engagement at your fingertips

Team name: **By the People**

Team members: [Sara Jade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-jade/), [Britini Malloy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/britini-malloy-a1a0b245/), [Drew Biehle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-biehle-844a2b15/), [Ren Burnett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renard-burnett-39170369/)

Project Pitch: [ForThePeople](https://forthepeeps.herokuapp.com/) is a civic engagement site where citizens can enter their information and the site will return their elected representatives and contact info. Then the user will be delivered a form to directly engage with their chosen representatives.

Problem: Registered voters would like to contact their elected representatives to let them know what issues are important to them, and they need contact info.

Solution: A web app that uses the Civic Info API from Google to find elected representatives and present contact information. Users can then write a letter to their representative in the app and either send as an email or print to mail in themselves.

Benefits: With contact information, citizens have a means to get laws passed and/or changed!

Stretch:
#1 Add how representatives voted.
#2 Add pictures of representatives.

For the People has a mobile-first UI and uses jQuery, Handlebars, and Page.js to create a single-page application om the client-side. Node.js accesses the Google Civic API to receive contact information for a user's elected representatives and communicates with a PostgreSQL database. The app is deployed using Heroku and developed using agile principles.

### Team member bios
Sara Jade: Sara is a pharmacist with who is changing careers. She has made the decision to go back to the future, doing what she almost did after graduating high school - software development! Along the way, she has obtained a degree in Information Systems, Software Development Track, from Bellevue College. She has also taught herself via Codecademy, the Railsbridge group, the Flatiron School, and Ada Developers Academy's Jumpstart program. Now she is an apprentice at Microsoft via Apprenti training at Codefellows.

Britini Malloy: After getting out of the Navy I worked at a bank and was looking for ideas before deciding to go back to school to use my GI Bill Benefits. I could not stand the system we used to do our daily work. I was constantly coming up with new ideas that would make the system better and more user friendly, and make our work more efficient. I enrolled in a Computer Information Systems program and I worked for both my Bachelor's then my Master's. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to help me get a job. Then the Apprenti program came along and gave me this great opportunity to go work for Micorosoft as a software dev apprentice.

Drew Biehle: I am a software developer on my way to an apprenticeship at Microsoft through Apprenti. I have a degree in film and 11 years of market research experience, a beautiful and talented wife and an eerie and amazing son, and I'm proud to say I've voted for Democrats, Republicans, and Green Party candidates. Once I even shared a selfie with Paul Simon (the bow-tied Senator, not the singer).

Renard Burnett: Ol' Renny is an ex-composite repair technician who decided that after 6 short years at Boeing it was time for a career change!
Something that involved fewer hazardous chemicals, more flexibility, and something that's never not interesting; computers and technology!
In the immortal words of Cosmo Kramer: "Giddyup!"
