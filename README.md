Project Pitch: **ForThePeople** is a civic engagement site where citizens can enter their information and the site will return their elected representatives.

Problem: People want to contact their elected representatives, and they need contact info.

Solution: A web app that uses the Civic Info API from Google to find elected representatives and present contact information.

Benefits: With contact information, citizens have a means to get laws passed and/or changed!

Stretch:
#1 Add how representatives voted.
#2 Add pictures of representatives.
