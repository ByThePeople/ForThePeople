          <h3>Drew Biehle</h3></a>
          <p>I am a software developer on my way to an apprenticeship at Microsoft through Apprenti. I have a degree in film and 11 years of market research experience, a beautiful and talented wife and an eerie and amazing son, and I'm proud to say I've voted for Democrats, Republicans, and Green Party candidates. Once I even shared a selfie with Paul Simon (the bow-tied Senator, not the singer).</p>

          Something that involved fewer hazardous chemicals, more flexibility, and something that's never not interesting; computers and technology!
